# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build an appointment management application with calendar views, time tracking, and alarm notifications.

**Planned changes:**
- Create appointment data model with title, description, date, time, duration, and alarm settings
- Implement CRUD operations for managing appointments
- Build calendar view showing appointments by date with month navigation
- Create appointment form with date/time pickers and alarm configuration
- Display chronological list view with filtering and search capabilities
- Implement browser-based alarm notifications for upcoming appointments
- Design dashboard showing today's appointments, upcoming week view, and statistics
- Apply warm neutral color scheme (beige, cream, soft gray) with sage green/muted teal accents

**User-visible outcome:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete appointments through a calendar interface and list view, receive visual alarm notifications for upcoming appointments, and see an overview dashboard with today's schedule and upcoming week.
